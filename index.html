    <h1>JavaScript History</h1>
    <h2>Origin of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript, initially named Mocha, was developed by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications
        Corporation in 1995.
        It was first introduced in Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. Originally conceived as a lightweight
        scripting language to complement Java,
        it underwent rapid iterations and was eventually renamed JavaScript. Its primary purpose was to enable dynamic
        content on web pages.
